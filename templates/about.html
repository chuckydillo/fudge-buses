        <h1>About FudgeBuses</h1>
        <p>Welcome to FudgeBuses! My goal is to provide a reliable platform for users to report and track bad bus services that are consistently late or canceled. I understand how frustrating it can be to depend on public transport, especially when buses fail to arrive on time or are canceled without notice.</p>
        
        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>My mission with FudgeBuses is to empower users by giving them a voice to report their experiences with bus services. By collecting and sharing these reports, I aim to create a transparent environment where users can make informed decisions about their travel options. This app is designed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable users to easily report late or canceled bus services.</li>
            <li>Provide a historical overview of bus service performance in your area.</li>
            <li>Allow users to view reports submitted by others, helping everyone stay informed.</li>
            <li>Encourage bus companies to improve their services through community feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why Track Bus Services?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Identify patterns in service disruptions.</li>
            <li>Improve accountability for bus companies.</li>
            <li>Help commuters find alternative travel options when needed.</li>
        </ul>
