# FudgeBuses

Welcome to FudgeBuses! This web application aims to provide a reliable platform for users to report and track bad bus services that are consistently late or canceled. Understanding the frustrations of relying on public transport, FudgeBuses empowers users to share their experiences and helps create a transparent environment for making informed travel decisions.

**My Mission**  
The mission of FudgeBuses is to give users a voice in reporting their experiences with bus services. The app enables users to easily report late or canceled services, providing a historical overview of bus service performance in their area. Users can view reports submitted by others, helping everyone stay informed about local bus services. Additionally, FudgeBuses encourages bus companies to improve their services through community feedback.

**Why Track Bus Services?**  
Public transportation is a vital part of many communities but can often be unreliable. By tracking bus services with FudgeBuses, users can identify patterns in service disruptions, improve accountability for bus companies, and find alternative travel options when needed. This platform aims to make public transportation more reliable and user-friendly for everyone.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
