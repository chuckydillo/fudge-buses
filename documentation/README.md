# FudgeBuses

Welcome to FudgeBuses! This web application aims to provide a reliable platform for users to report and track bad bus services that are consistently late or canceled. Understanding the frustrations of relying on public transport, FudgeBuses empowers users to share their experiences and helps create a transparent environment for making informed travel decisions.

**My Mission**  
The mission of FudgeBuses is to give users a voice in reporting their experiences with bus services. The app enables users to easily report late or canceled services, providing a historical overview of bus service performance in their area. Users can will be able to view the collective data submitted by others, helping everyone stay informed about local bus services. Additionally, FudgeBuses hopes that this will put pressure and encourage bus companies to improve their services.

**Why Track Bus Services?**  
Public transportation is a vital part of many communities but can often be unreliable. By tracking bus services with FudgeBuses, users can identify patterns in service disruptions, improve accountability for bus companies, and find alternative travel options when needed. This platform aims to make public transportation more reliable and user-friendly for everyone.

## Agile

For FudgeBuses, I used Agile planning to stay organized throughout the project. GitHub Projects was a helpful tool where I could create tasks, boards, and milestones.

### MoSCoW Prioritization
I followed the MoSCoW Prioritization method to decide what features were most important for FudgeBuses which i applied to labels in the user stories:

- **Must Haves**: These were the essential features that had to be completed first. Finishing the "must haves" allowed me to create a basic, working version of the app (MVP).
- **Should Haves**: These features were important but not critical at first. They could wait until after the "must haves" were done.
- **Could Haves**: Nice-to-have features, which would be great if time allowed after the higher priority work was finished.
- **Won't Haves**: These were features that didn’t fit the project right now or were low priority for this version.

Using this method helped keep me focused on what mattered most during development.


## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

For deployment on Heroku, I used the Code Institute produced guide. A copy of which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14SR7GJW1zH6vre7Dlh-OLrjpVHWbs84w119smExxso0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
